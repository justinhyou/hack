1. Run the forms example (Lec17.pdf) first to make sure that your
   simple app with Flask is working before trying something more
   complex like myblog.

2. Now to run myblog, structure your myblog app this way:

   myblog/myblog.py
         /message.py
         /static/light.css
                /light.html
                /light.js
                /pic_bulboff.gif
                /pic_bulbon.gif
                /style.css
         /templates/layout.html
                   /login.html
                   /show_entries.html

3. To run myblog app

   1. Go to myblog folder using a Command/Terminal window

   2. Do the following on a command prompt:

          command_prompt> python myblog.py  [to start your server]

   3. Access it using: http://127.0.0.1:5000/

   4. Login with username (admin) and password (default)

   5. Start adding things to the blog database

   6. When done, logout



4. To access static pages from myblog app:

   1. Place the static files such as CSS, images, JavaScript files under
      myblog/static/ 

   2. Then, access it with http://localhost:5000/static/light.html if
      light.html is the file you want to access from the static area

   3. You will see from myblog example that I show how light.html is
      linked to the main templates page (see show_entries.html).
